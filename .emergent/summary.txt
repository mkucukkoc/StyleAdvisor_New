**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to build the complete frontend for a production-ready React Native mobile app named StyleAdvisor AI using Expo and TypeScript. The initial request evolved from building a 10-screen MVP to implementing the full 48-screen product requirement document (PRD), including all components, state management, i18n, theming, and a mocked API layer.

The latest user request has pivoted the project's direction. The user has provided a GitHub repository and instructed the next agent to pull the code from there to start working on integrating the frontend with an existing backend, particularly for authentication, and to create the necessary backend endpoint files.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS**:
- **Full Frontend Implementation**: Build all 48 screens as defined in the PRD, including Auth, Onboarding, Home, Analyze, Wardrobe, Favorites, and Profile/Settings sections.
- **Stack**: Expo, React Native, TypeScript, React Navigation, Zustand, React Query, Axios, i18next.
- **Backend Integration**: The new primary goal is to connect the frontend to a real backend.
    - Pull the latest code from the user-provided GitHub repository: .
    - Integrate the frontend's authentication flow with the existing backend Google authentication endpoints.
    - Create placeholder files for all other required backend endpoints under .
- **Premium Logic**: Implement access control for free vs. premium users (e.g., analysis limits, locked features).
- **Mock API**: Until real endpoints are integrated, all other backend interactions should be mocked.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Support for English (en) and Turkish (tr).
- **Design**: Premium, modern feel with accent color #7C3AED and Inter font.

**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to build the complete frontend for a production-ready React Native mobile app named StyleAdvisor AI. The frontend should be built with Expo and TypeScript. The task requires a code-first approach, delivering a runnable application with a complete folder structure, navigation, screens, components, theme, i18n, state management (Zustand & React Query), and a mocked API client.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS**:
- **Stack**: Expo, React Native, TypeScript, React Navigation, Zustand, React Query, Axios, AsyncStorage, i18next.
- **Design**: Premium, modern feel with a specific accent color (#7C3AED) and Inter font.
- **Modules**: Auth, Onboarding, Main Tabs (Home, Analyze, Wardrobe, Favorites, Profile).
- **MVP Scope**: A list of 47 specific screens to be fully built out.
- **Premium Logic**: Implement access control for free vs. premium users (e.g., analysis limits, locked features).
- **API Layer**: All backend interactions must be mocked with typed contracts.
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Support for English (en) and Turkish (tr).
- **User Preferences**:
    - **Authentication**: Use mock authentication, storing a fake token in .
    - **Assets**: Use simple colored placeholders and local icons instead of generating external images.
    - **Font**: Integrate the 'Inter' font using  with a fallback to system fonts.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish (Türkçe). The next agent MUST respond in Turkish.

**what currently exists?**
<<<<<<< HEAD
The project is a comprehensive, nearly-complete frontend application.
- All 48+ screens from the PRD have been created as runnable  files within the  directory using Expo Router.
- A full library of reusable components (, , , , etc.) exists in .
- Complete state management is set up with Zustand, including 8 distinct stores (, , , etc.) with persistence for .
- A complete mocked API layer exists under , with defined Axios clients, endpoints, and mock data. Stubs for React Query (, hooks) have also been created.
- Full i18n support for English and Turkish is implemented, with extensive translation keys in  and .
- A complete theming system (Light/Dark) is in place.
- A  file has been started.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The agent was creating a comprehensive UI/UX documentation file at  as per the user's request.
- **Status**: BLOCKED. This task was interrupted and superseded by the user's new, high-priority request to pull code from a GitHub repository and begin backend integration.
- **Agent Testing Done**: N/A
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: N/A
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Web Preview is Broken (P2)**
    - **Description**: The web preview ([16:41:11] Starting project at /app/frontend) fails to render the application, getting stuck on a loading screen or showing a white page with a console error: . This is a known, complex compatibility issue between Expo SDK 54, React 19, and their dependencies for the web platform.
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent spent significant time debugging this, trying to downgrade React, update dependencies (), and configure Babel. None of these attempts were successful. The final decision was to abandon the web preview and focus on mobile development via Expo Go.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1. Defer fixing this until mobile functionality is fully verified.
        2. If required, the next step would be a major dependency alignment, potentially downgrading the entire Expo SDK to a stable version known to work with React 18 (e.g., SDK 51/52) or waiting for a future Expo SDK that fully supports React 19 on the web.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: A working web preview allows for faster UI iteration and debugging. However, it is not critical for the core mobile app functionality.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
- **Issue 2: ESLint Parsing Errors (P3)**
    - **Description**: Running  shows multiple parsing errors in  files ().
    - **Attempted fixes**: None. The agent correctly identified this as a non-blocking linter configuration issue, likely missing the TypeScript parser setup in the ESLint config, and proceeded with development.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1. Check  to ensure  is correctly configured for  files.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Fixes code quality and ensures the linter works correctly, providing useful feedback during development.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?**: N

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Create UI/UX Documentation (P2)**
    - **Where to resume**: The file  was partially created. The agent needs to continue adding sections for each of the app's screens and flows.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: A comprehensive document detailing the app's UI, user flows, and component interactions, as requested by the user.
    - **Status**: BLOCKED (by the higher priority task of backend integration). This should only be resumed after confirming with the user.
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: N/A

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **(P0) Pull from GitHub & Re-baseline Project**
    - The user has provided a new source of truth: .
    - The first and most critical action is to pull the code from this repository into the workspace.
    - This may overwrite, conflict with, or add to the current codebase. A careful  or code review will be needed to understand the changes.
- **(P0) Integrate Real Backend Authentication**
    - The user stated that backend authentication (including Google login) is already implemented.
    - The agent must investigate the backend code (in ) to understand the API endpoints for login, registration, and Google auth.
    - Update the frontend  () and the Auth screens (, ) to call these real API endpoints instead of the mock ones.
- **(P1) Scaffold All Backend Endpoints**
    - The user requested that all necessary backend endpoint files be created.
    - Based on the existing frontend API contracts (), create corresponding placeholder Python files in the  directory for each feature (e.g., , , ).
- **(P2) Complete Frontend/Backend Integration**
    - After auth is working, systematically replace all other mocked API calls in the frontend with real calls to the newly created backend endpoints.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full Frontend Scaffolding to Completion**: Expanded the initial project structure to a fully-featured frontend application.
- **Screen Implementation**: Implemented the UI and logic for all ~50 screens defined in the PRD, including all edge states (loading, error, empty).
- **Component Library**: Created a comprehensive library of 15+ reusable UI components, including , , and .
- **State Management**: Set up 8 Zustand stores for granular state control and created stubs for React Query hooks.
- **Premium Logic**: Created the files and placeholder function () for gating premium features.
- **i18n Expansion**: Fully populated  and  with all necessary strings for all screens and components.
- **Navigation & Deep Linking**: Configured the complete navigation structure with Expo Router, including stacks, tabs, and modals, and set up the deep link configuration in .
- **Documentation**: Began creating the  file.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- The web preview  issue is the primary one. It was actively debugged but ultimately deferred.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- The  error related to web compatibility was a persistent, recurring blocker during the session.
=======
The agent has successfully scaffolded the entire frontend project structure. This includes:
- Installation of all required dependencies via yarn install v1.22.22

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
<<<<<<< HEAD
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo (SDK 54)
- **Routing**: File-based routing with Expo Router v6
- **State Management**: Zustand (global/client state), React Query (server state)
- **Styling**: StyleSheet API with a custom theme provider for light/dark modes.
- **API Layer**: Axios client with a fully mocked API, now transitioning to a real FastAPI backend.
- **Internationalization**:  for TR/EN languages.

**key DB schema**
- N/A. The focus is shifting to backend API creation, but no schema has been defined yet.

**changes in tech stack**
- The project is pivoting from a frontend-only (mocked API) architecture to a full-stack application with a real backend integration.

**All files of reference**
- : Shows the problematic dependency versions (React 19, Expo 54).
- : Contains the newly added deep linking configuration.
- : Created in an attempt to fix the web bundling issue.
- : Contains the premium gating logic.
- : Contains keys for React Query.
- : The documentation file that was being worked on.
- : The user-provided repository, which is the new source of truth.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **PRIORITY #1: PULL FROM GITHUB.** Do not start any work until you have successfully pulled the code from . This is the user's explicit instruction and the new baseline for the project.
- **PIVOT TO BACKEND.** The task has changed from finish frontend to integrate backend. Your primary focus is now on connecting the UI to real API endpoints, starting with authentication.
- **IGNORE WEB PREVIEW.** The web preview is broken due to a deep dependency issue. Do not waste time trying to fix it. Use the Expo Go QR code for mobile testing.
- **USER LANGUAGE IS TURKISH.** All communication with the user must be in Turkish.

**documents created in this job**
-  (Partially complete)

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
- **User (Msg 399, 400):** Repeated the full PRD, asking the agent to finish everything on the frontend.
- **Agent (Msg 401-439):** Executed the request, creating all remaining files for the full PRD (components, screens, hooks, i18n keys) and verified completion.
- **User (Msg 440):** Changed direction, asking for visual UI mockups of all screens.
- **Agent (Msg 441):** Correctly explained its inability to create images and offered to create a detailed UI/UX documentation file instead.
- **User (Msg 442):** Agreed and asked for a detailed document with screenshots (placeholders) and flow descriptions.
- **Agent (Msg 443-454):** Started creating the  file.
- **User (Msg 455):** **CRITICAL PIVOT.** Interrupted the documentation task with new instructions:
    1. Pull the latest code from .
    2. Integrate the frontend with existing backend Google authentication.
    3. Create all other necessary backend endpoint files.
- **Status:** The agent acknowledged the new request and was about to start. This is the handoff point.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken**: The Expo web preview is non-functional.
- **Mocked**: The entire API layer is currently mocked, but the next task is to replace it with a real backend.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- A full suite of Expo and React Native libraries are used (see ). No external keys are currently required as the API is mocked.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: YES (called twice for the web compatibility issue)
- **Test files created**: None
- **Known regressions**: None at the mobile app level. The web preview is a known broken feature.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- N/A. Authentication is currently mocked. The next task is to integrate it with the real backend, which may require credentials or a specific setup flow.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent did not forget any explicit instructions. It successfully completed the massive task of building the entire frontend according to the PRD. The  web issue was a technical limitation that was handled by pivoting strategy with user confirmation. The latest user request to pull from GitHub arrived just as the previous task was being completed.
=======
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Routing**: File-based routing with Expo Router v3

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Speak Turkish**: The user has communicated in Turkish, and all future responses should be in Turkish.
- **Massive UI Implementation Ahead**: The entire project structure is built, but all screen files are empty placeholders. The primary job is to fill these files with UI code.
- **Follow the PRD**: The initial prompt is extremely detailed. Refer to it for screen layouts, feature logic, and implementation details.
- **Mock Everything**: Do not attempt to build a backend. All data comes from the mocked API layer in .
- **Start with Fonts**: A small but important next step is to add the Inter font files to the project and load them before proceeding with UI implementation.

**documents created in this job**
- None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User Message (Message 9)**: The user responded in Turkish, giving clear instructions:
    - Use mock authentication.
    - Use simple, colored placeholders and icons for assets (no external image generation).
    - Integrate the Inter font with a system font fallback.
    - Reiterated that core MVP screens should be fully functional, with runnable placeholders for others.
